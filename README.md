# README
This is the link to clone the repo locally ``` https://github.com/corina-m-feraru/network-routing ```
In order to call the service and verify results please type ``` rails connected_routers:get ``` in your rails console.
In order to run all the tests just simply run ```rspec``` in your rails console -- as it is just 2 tests within the repo - it should be pretty fast.
Thank you!
